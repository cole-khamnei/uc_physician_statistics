# UC Physician Inferred Gender Pay Disparities
Using `gender_guesser`, gender was inferred using workers' first names. Obviously, this model relies on many assumptions and the gender groups will contain some members from other gender groups. With this consideration, the model is still robust and any statistical differences should be interpretted as lower bounds of the actual differences.
